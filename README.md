# SSW-567-HW2

1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
Mainly refreshing what constitutes a triangle, remembering the rules for what makes a triangle not a triangle.
2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
I think it was really clear and sufficient (obviously I will know for sure if this was the case when I get the grade, but I think I was able to accomplish all parts successfully).
3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
No challenges
4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
I just made sure I was testing for each case of what makes a triangle a specific type, and testing to make sure for each "or" in the "if" statement for NotATriangle that each case would present the proper output (meaning, I checked to see if a, b, or c were 0 that it would give NotATriangle instead of just checking for 1 case like if just a was 0).
